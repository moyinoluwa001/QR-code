### Screenshot

![](./Screenshot (207).png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of responsive design, including:

Using the min-height property to center content vertically within the viewport.
Applying Flexbox to create a clean, centered layout for the component.
Writing reusable and readable CSS.
Here’s an example of the CSS code I’m particularly proud of:

css
Copy
Edit
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
Continued Development
I plan to continue improving my skills in:

Accessibility (making components even more screen-reader friendly).
Advanced CSS techniques, including Grid and animations.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```
